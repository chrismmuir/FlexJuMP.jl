    "text": "FlexJuMP.jl provides a computational framework to analyze and quantify system flexibility. It was originally developed as a JuMP extension to automate the setup and computation of the flexibility index problem with several different types of uncertainty sets. However, it is currently being expanded to compute a number of useful metrics and carry out helpful analyses. Currently, it capabilities include:Computing the flexibility index with ellipsoidal, hyperbox, or p-norm uncertainty sets\nChecking nominal point (mean) feasibility\nComputing the stochastic flexibility index via Monte Carlo sampling methods\nUsing the flexibility index to expedite the solution to the stochastic flexibility index\nComputing the analytic and feasible centers of the feasible region to better nominal points\nComputing the confidence level which provides a lower bound on the stochastic flexibility index\nRanking the most limiting system constraints via iterative solution of the flexibility index problemThese techniques are described in greater detail in Background.note: Note\nCurrently, FlexJuMP only accepts linear constraints and assumes the random variables to be multivariate Gaussian with a certain mean and covariance matrix specified by the user. Development is underway to allow for quadratic constraints and general nonlinear constraints.  "

    "text": "The stochastic flexibility index SF is a flexibility metric for systems that are subjected to uncertain parameters (e.g., disturbances, physical parameters) that are modeled as random variables, and is defined as the probability of finding recourse to maintain feasible operation.

This is done by assessing the feasibility of each realization. Such an approach converges exponentially with the number of MC samples but typically requires a very large number of samples leading to scalability issues. One possible alternative is to estimate the stochastic vulnerability index SV = 1 - SF which can be determined by incorporating all of the MC samples in one large linear program:beginequation\nbeginaligned\nmin_mathbfz^k mathbfx^k y^k in mathbbR  frac1K sum_k = 1^K y^k \ntextst  f_j(mathbfz^k mathbfx^k boldsymboltheta^k) leq y^k  j in J   k = 1 K \n h_i(mathbfz^k mathbfx^k boldsymboltheta^k) = 0  i in I   k = 1K \n y^k geq 0  k = 1K\nendaligned\nendequationwhere K is the number of samples.

    "text": "The so-called flexibility index problem provides a more scalable approach to quantifying flexibility. This approach seeks to identify the largest uncertainty set T(delta) (where delta in mathbbR_+ is a parameter that scales T) for which the system remains feasible. In other words, we seek to find the largest uncertainty set under which there exists recourse to recover feasibility. The flexibility index F is defined as:beginequation\n	beginaligned\n		 F =  max_deltainmathbbR_+ delta \n		textst  max_boldsymboltheta in T(delta) psi(boldsymboltheta) leq 0\n	endaligned\nendequationThis approach is illustrated with a traditional hyperbox set below.(Image: sf_index)This approach is deterministic in nature; consequently, it does not have a direct probabilistic interpretation (as the SF index does). By transforming the inner problem in terms of its first order KKT conditions we obtain the following mixed integer formulation which is valid for any compact T(delta):beginequation\n	beginaligned\n		F = min_delta mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta lambda_j s_j y_j mu_j  delta \n		textst  f_j(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta)+ s_j = 0  j in J \n		 h_i(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta) = 0  i in I \n		 sum_j in J lambda_j = 1 \n		 sum_j in J lambda_j fracpartial f_j(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta)partial mathbfz + sum_i in I mu_i fracpartial h_i(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta)partial mathbfz= 0 \n		 s_j leq U(1 - y_j)  j in J \n		 lambda_j leq y_j  j in J \n		 boldsymboltheta in T(delta)  \n		 lambda_j s_j geq 0     y_j in 0 1  j in J\n	endaligned\nendequationThis formulation can be rather tedious to implement and thus it what originally motivated the development of FlexJuMP.

    "text": "Any compact set can be used to compute the flexibility index. The table below shows the 5 types FlexJuMP currently employs. Here barboldsymboltheta is the nominal point (mean), V_boldsymboltheta is the covariance matrix, and Deltaboldsymboltheta^- Deltaboldsymboltheta^+ are maximum lower and upper deviations, respectively. In FlexJuMP these sets are specified via setuncertaintyset.Name Uncertainty Set\nEllipsoidal Norm T_ellip(delta) = boldsymboltheta  lVertboldsymboltheta - barboldsymbolthetarVert_V_boldsymboltheta^-1^2 leq delta \nHyperbox Set T_box(delta) = boldsymboltheta  barboldsymboltheta - deltaDeltaboldsymboltheta^- leq boldsymboltheta leq barboldsymboltheta + deltaDeltaboldsymboltheta^+\nell_infty Norm T_infty(delta) = boldsymboltheta  lVertboldsymboltheta - barboldsymbolthetarVert_infty leq delta \nell_1 Norm T_1(delta) = boldsymboltheta  lVertboldsymboltheta - barboldsymbolthetarVert_1 leq delta \nell_2 Norm T_2(delta) = boldsymboltheta  lVertboldsymboltheta - barboldsymbolthetarVert_2 leq delta We observe that T(delta) can be represented by any combination of the uncertainty sets in the table above or other sets (provided that the resulting combined set is compact). This provides the ability to incorporate physical knowledge on the uncertain parameters and/or to create a wider range of uncertainty set shapes. For instance, the positive (truncated) ellipsoidal set T_ellip+(delta) = T_ellip(delta) cap mathbbR_+^n_theta, where mathbbR_+^n_theta = boldsymboltheta  boldsymboltheta geq 0 can be used to represent parameters that are known to be non-negative (e.g., demands, prices). The in FlexJuMP the only_positive option enables the intersection of the sets mentioned above with the positive set mathbbR_+^n_theta.One advantage of using T_ellip(delta)  is that the associated flexibility index (denoted by F_ellip) can be used to obtain the confidence level:beginequation\n	alpha^* = fracgamma(fracn_theta2 fracF_ellip2)Gamma(fracn_theta2)\nendequationwhere gamma(cdot) and Gamma(cdot) are the incomplete and complete gamma functions. Interestingly, this confidence level provides a lower bound for the stochastic flexibility index SF (i.e., alpha^*leq SF). This thus provides an avenue to obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the deterministic flexibility index while avoiding MC sampling. This confidence level can be obtained with the getconfidencelevel function.For flexibility analysis it is critical that barboldsymboltheta be feasible, thus the function [ismeanfeasible] is used to verify the mean\'s feasibility. In some applications, specifying barboldsymboltheta might be difficult if not enough data is available or if a system is not routinely operated at any given point (e.g., a power grid). Thus, we introduce methods that can be employed to find well-centered nominal points.The analytic center barboldsymboltheta_ac can be defined by:beginequation\n	beginaligned\n		barboldsymboltheta_ac in  undersetboldsymboltheta mathbfz mathbfx smathrmargmax  sum_j in J log left(s_j right) \n		textst  f_j(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta) +s_jleq 0  j in J \n		 h_i(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta) = 0  i in I\n	endaligned\nendequationHere, s_jin mathbbR are slack variables. This problems pushes the constraints to the interior of the feasible region and gives the analytic center as the point that maximizes the geometric mean of the constraints (slack variables). The feasible center barboldsymboltheta_fc is the point that maximizes the worst-case slack variable and is given by:beginequation\n	beginaligned\n		barboldsymboltheta_fc in undersetboldsymboltheta mathbfz mathbfx smathrmargmax  s \n		textst  f_j(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta) + s leq 0  j in J \n		 h_i(mathbfz mathbfx boldsymboltheta) = 0  i in I\n	endaligned\nendequationIn FlexJuMP these centers can be computed using the findcenteredmean function."

    "text": "The flexibility index is a valuable metric that can be used to compare system designs. The utility and interpretation of the index for a system will depend on the choice of T(delta). For instance, the index can be used to determine the confidence level alpha^* if the set T_ellip(delta) is used when boldsymboltheta  sim mathcalN(barboldsymboltheta V_boldsymboltheta). The index might not have a clear interpretation or utility for some choices of T(delta) but can still be useful to quantify improvements in flexibility from design modifications (retrofits). An example of comparing two systems with ellipsoidal and hyperbox sets is shown below.(Image: comparison)It is apparent that Design B has a larger feasible region Theta and thus has a larger SF index. Both sets reflect this behavior and could be used to make a comparison without having to compute the SF index. A key observation is that the choice of T(delta) significantly affects how it measures system flexibility. For instance, for Design B, the ellipsoidal and hyperbox sets identify different limiting constraints, and thus exhibit distinct behavior. In particular, index F_box is limited by constraint f_2 and would not change if constraints f_1, f_3, and/or f_4 were varied to increase the area of Theta, even though the overall system flexibility would be improved. On the other hand, index F_ellip is limited by constraint f_1. This conservative behavior parallels what is observed with the use of uncertainty sets in robust optimization, where such sets are used to optimize against the worst case scenario such that the solution is robust in the face of uncertainty, and the conservativeness of a solution depends on the chosen shape of the uncertainty set.The flexibility index problem can also be used to rank constraints that most limit system flexibility, since it implicitly identifies constraints that limit flexibility. Specifically, at the solution of the flexibility index problem, the binary variables y_j indicate which constraints are active and therefore limit flexibility. Thus, the flexibility index problem can be resolved by excluding this first set of limiting constraints, so that the next set of limiting constraints can be identified. This step can be repeated to rank system constraints to a desired extent (as long as the solution of the problem is bounded). This is done by noticing that each set of limiting constraints will have an associated flexibility index, which indicates how limiting a particular set of constraints is relative to the other sets. This methodology can also be used to identify and rank system components that limit flexibility in order to guide design improvements or quantify value of specific components. Limiting constraint information can also be used to quantify the impact of failure of system components (e.g., a production facility). This process is illustrated in the figure below.(Image: comparison)This shows how limiting (active) constraints are iteratively turned off to find subsequent limiting constraints. In FlexJuMP the function rankinequalities automatically carries out this iterative methodology. Also, for a particular solved flexibility model m, the active constraint indexes can be retrieved via the getactiveconstraints function.  "
