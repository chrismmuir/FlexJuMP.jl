# FlexJuMP.jl

A package for analyzing and quantifying the flexibility of complex systems.

## Overview
FlexJuMP.jl provides a computational framework to analyze and quantify system flexibility.
It was originally developed as a JuMP extension to automate the setup and computation of the
flexibility index problem with several different types of uncertainty sets. However, it is currently
being expanded to compute a number of useful metrics and carry out helpful analyses. Currently,
it capabilities include:
- Computing the flexibility index with ellipsoidal, hyperbox, or p-norm uncertainty sets
- Checking nominal point (mean) feasibility
- Computing the stochastic flexibility index via Monte Carlo sampling methods
- Using the flexibility index to expedite the solution to the stochastic flexibility index
- Computing the analytic and feasible centers of the feasible region to better nominal points
- Computing the confidence level which provides a lower bound on the stochastic flexibility index
- Ranking the most limiting system constraints via iterative solution of the flexibility index problem

These techniques are described in greater detail in [Background](@ref).

!!! note
    Currently, FlexJuMP only accepts linear constraints and assumes the random variables to
    multivariate Gaussian with a certain mean and covariance matrix specified by the user. Development
    is underway to allow for quadratic constraints and general nonlinear constraints.  

## Installation
FlexJuMP.jl is not yet a registered Julia package, but can still be installed by providing the package manager
with the url of the repository instead of the name.

```julia
Pkg.clone("git://github.com/pulsipher/FlexJuMP.jl.git")
```
Also, FlexJuMP.jl only supports Julia 0.6, but soon will be compatible with Julia 0.7 and
Julia 1.0.

## Quick Start
Below is a brief example of the high-level API, more explanation and examples are provided in [User Guide](@ref) and [Examples](@ref).

```julia
using FlexJuMP, JuMP
using Gurobi

# Setup the uncertainty set parameters
means = [620; 388; 583; 313]
covar = [11.11 0 0 0; 0 11.11 0 0; 0 0 11.11 0; 0 0 0 11.11]

# Setup the model
m = FlexibilityModel(solver = GurobiSolver(OutputFlag = 0))

# Define variables
@randomvariable(m, T[i = 1:4], mean = means[i])
@recoursevariable(m, Qc)

# Define the constraints
@constraint(m, -0.67Qc + T[2] <= 350)
@constraint(m, 0.5Qc - 0.75T[1] - T[2] - T[3] <= -1388.5)
@constraint(m, -Qc + 1.5T[1] + 2T[2] + T[3] >= 2044)
@constraint(m, Qc - 1.5T[1] - 2T[2] - T[3] - 2T[4] <= -2830)
@constraint(m, -Qc + 1.5T[1] + 2T[2] + T[3] + 3T[4] <= 3153)

# Define the uncertainty set
setuncertaintyset(m, :Ellipsoid, covar)

# Solve
status = solve(m)

# Retrieve optimized data
flexibility_index = getflexibilityindex(m)
conf_lvl = getconfidencelevel(m)
critical_temperatures = getvalue(T)
critical_cooling = getvalue(Qc)
actives_constrs = getactiveconstraints(m)

# Print results
print(flexibility_index)
